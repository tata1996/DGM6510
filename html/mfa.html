                <h2>About the MFA</h2>

                The original MFA was founded in 1870 and opened its doors to the<br> public on July 4, 1876, the nation’s centennial. Built in Copley Square,<br> the MFA was then home to 5,600 works of art. Over the next several<br> years, the collection and number of visitors grew exponentially, and in <br>1909 the Museum moved to its current home on Huntington Avenue.<br>
                <p></p>

                Today the MFA is one of the most comprehensive art museums in the<br> world; the collection encompasses nearly 500,000 works of art. We<br> welcome more than one million visitors each year to experience art<br> from ancient Egyptian to contemporary, special exhibitions, and <br>innovative educational programs.<br>
                <p></p>

                The Museum has undergone significant expansion and change in <br>recent years; 2010 marked the opening of the Art of the Americas<br> Wing, with four levels of American art from ancient to modern. In<br> 2011, the west wing of the Museum was transformed into the Linde <br>Family Wing for Contemporary Art, with new galleries for<br> contemporary art and social and learning spaces. Improved and new<br> galleries for the MFA collections are always opening.<br>
                <p></p>

                Next to the Museum is the School of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston,<br> established in 1876. In 2016, the School became part of Tufts <br>University’s School of Arts and Sciences.
